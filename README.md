#### Parsing the MEC events API
From mid-2012 while working at MEC in Vancouver. Tasked with creating a script to display events from the new events.mec.ca website for display on various pages on www.mec.ca.

Features include multi-language support, localized time zone display, and use of parameters to filter by activity type, location, etc.
